# Welcome!
Thank you for playing Economica!

##Things you should know about ....

##Immersive Railroading
Immersive Railroading can be difficult to play with for people that aren't familiar with it.
Luckily though, Immersive Railroading has integration with the In-Game Wiki mod.
So if you can't figure it out, just press the ____ button, or whatever you've set the In-Game Wiki mod to, and there'll be a handy-dandy guide on how to do stuff in the Immersive Railroading mod.

##Day 1 Tools
Economica has Tinker's Construct.
It also has Tinkered Hegemony.
Tinkered Hegemony disables all vanilla tools/weapons, forcing you to use only Thinker Construct for your tools and weapons.
It also replaces vanilla style tool and weapons in the recipes in other mods that have a vanilla tool as an ingrediant.
Please notify us as soon as you can if you see a recipe that's still set to a vanilla style tool/weapon so that we can try fixing it using CraftTweaker.


##I have an issue, where do I report it?
You can report an issue with the pack or the official server on the GitHub at this url....
